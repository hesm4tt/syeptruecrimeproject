                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Ted Bundy had a really confusing childhood. For years, he thought his mom was his sister and his grandparents were his parents, which was a big secret to keep him from being seen as illegitimate. He was also pretty shy and lonely, even though people thought he was a polite kid.
                </p>

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Yeah, there were definitely some warning signs. His aunt remembered waking up once when he was three to find knives placed all around her bed. As a teenager, he also liked to peep in people's windows, which is super creepy and a major red flag.
                </p>

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    On the outside, his adult life looked pretty normal, which is the scary part. He graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in psychology and even went to law school for a while. He was also involved in politics, working for Washington's governor.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    He had a long-term girlfriend named Elizabeth Kloepfer who had no idea what he was doing for a long time. During his trial in Florida, he actually married a woman named Carole Ann Boone and they had a daughter. So no, he wasn't exactly a loner, which made it harder for people to suspect him.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    This is a tricky one. Doctors who studied him had different opinions, but many said he had antisocial personality disorder, which is basically what people mean when they say "psychopath." He was charming and smart on the outside, but he didn't feel any empathy or guilt for what he did.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    His crimes were horrible; he kidnapped, raped, and murdered many young women between 1974 and 1978. He confessed to killing 30 women in seven states, but police think there might have been even more. He often faked an injury or pretended to be a police officer to get his victims to trust him.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    When he was first caught, he was super calm and confident, almost arrogant. He escaped from jail twice! He seemed to enjoy the attention and the cat-and-mouse game he was playing with the police.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    He was definitely found capable to stand trial, even though his lawyers tried to argue he wasn't. For his big trial in Florida, the judge was Edward D. Cowart. Bundy even acted as his own lawyer for part of it, which was a crazy move that got a lot of media attention.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                   The prosecutors used some really solid evidence, like a bite mark on one of the victims that they matched to Bundy's teeth. Bundy, acting as his own lawyer, tried to be charming and poke holes in the evidence, but he just came off as weird and cocky. The jury saw right through his act.

                    For the crimes in Florida, he was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, and burglary. After the jury found him guilty, the judge sentenced him to death. He got three separate death sentences for his crimes.

                    The media went crazy over his trial because he didn't look like a typical killer. Newspapers called him handsome and charming, and it was one of the first big trials to be broadcast on national TV. Everyone was shocked that someone who seemed so normal could do such terrible things.

                   He is not still alive. After all his appeals ran out, he was executed in the electric chair at Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989. He died exactly how he was sentenced to.
